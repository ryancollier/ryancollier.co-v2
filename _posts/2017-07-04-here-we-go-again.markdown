Here is the first post of this site. I hope it's as good for you as it is for me. Just gotta get a little bit better everyday. Tomorrow a little better than yesterday, and next week an enormous amount better than this week. That's the thing. It's never a big giant thing. Instead it's one little thing after the other. Compounding interest of doing small things to make them great.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
