I’m a product designer living in Seattle, Washington. I have been doing human-centered design for 9-plus years. I’m most interested and motivated by projects that attempt to make the world a better place in some small--or big!--way.

I have worked on a variety of products and services in education, healthcare, and government. I like to work as a generalist, but enjoy the challenge of learning quickly and diving deep into problems.

I am a collaborator. I like to ship product. I think of the role of product design in a broad way with the aim to uncover and align human needs and business outcomes.

Before getting into design, I worked on technology and media for people with disabilities.

I earned a Master of Science in Human Centered Design and Engineering from the University of Washington.

_Always learning. Love design, music, food, and laughing out loud!_
