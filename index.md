I’m a product designer living in Seattle, Washington. I have been doing human-centered design for 9-plus years. I’m most interested and motivated by projects that attempt to make the world a better place in some small--or big!--way.

I have worked on a variety of products and services in education, healthcare, and government. I like to work as a generalist, but enjoy the challenge of learning quickly and diving deep into problems.
