title: Highlights from My Last 2.5 Years at Socrata

<p class="lead">My last two and half years at Socrata have been challenging, rewarding, at-times-frustrating, and an overall fun experience. Reflecting on this reinforces my appreciation for this mission-driven company.</p>

I was matched with a great team from the start; we tackled interesting projects where I could contribute and grow. Both the work and the people have stretched my abilities and my imagination. Importantly, I've had the chance to learn every single day.

## I’ve shipped product
I’ve been able to ship a lot of software and maintain strong human-centered design methods and process.

## Growth
I’ve experienced a tremendous amount of personal and professional growth in this time as well.

When I started at Socrata, I wanted nothing more than to work with a really great, collaborative, and engaged design team. I got what I wanted and more. Not only were there other designers to collaborate with, but the product management team provided a great deal of opportunities for me to learn and build my thinking.

In December of 2015, my wife and I had a happy, healthy baby girl, Rilla. What a life changing experience that has been!

In early 2016, after shipping 6 major product initiatives, I was promoted to Senior Product Designer.

In July 2016, Socrata underwent a partial company restructuring and I was asked to lead the design team. This was a challenge that wasn’t anywhere on my radar (at the time, I was screening candidates for a design director or design manager position). Perhaps a little reluctantly, I agreed to this under the condition that the rest of the design team give a strong thumbs up on the move.

Since then, I’ve recruited and grown our design team to 6 full-time designers with a target to bring on a principal researcher to drive our discovery work and research efforts. In many ways, I feel that I’m actively working toward making myself obsolete!  

## What next?
I’ve still got a lot of learning to do. I’d like to continue to hone my craft as a designer and product-thinker. I’m also challenging myself as a person manger as well as driving the definition and execution of product design processes at Socrata.

If there’s anything I miss from my early days at the company and at previous organizations, it’s the focus, speed, and challenge of going after something new and unknown. For now, Socrata continues to provide a good deal of this for me as a manager and team lead. And I’m always curious to learn what new and interesting things are out there, just around the corner.
