title: Highlights from my time at Socrata
permalink: /work/socrata/
---

I spent almost 3 years working in product design for Socrata. It was truly an awesome experience in design and as a member of the Socrata family. I have a deep appreciation and profound respect for the mission-driven company.

I was matched with a great team from the start; we tackled interesting projects where I could contribute and grow. Both the work and the people  stretched my abilities and my imagination. Importantly, I had the chance to learn every single day.

## I’ve shipped product
I shipped a lot of software and maintained strong human-centered design methods and process.

## Growth
I  experienced a tremendous amount of personal and professional growth at Socrata.

When I started at Socrata, I wanted nothing more than to work with a really great, collaborative, and engaged design team. I got what I wanted and more. Not only were there other designers to collaborate with, but the product management team provided a great deal of opportunities for me to learn and build my thinking.

In early 2016, after shipping 6 major product initiatives, I was moved into a senior designer role, leading design projects across multiple product and business teams.

In July 2016, Socrata underwent a partial company restructuring and I was asked to lead the design team. This was a challenge that wasn’t anywhere on my radar (at the time, I was screening candidates for a design director or design manager position). Perhaps a little reluctantly, I agreed to this under the condition that the rest of the design team give a strong thumbs up on the move. They did.

I recruited and grew the design team to 6 full-time designers.

## What next?
I’ve still got a lot of learning to do. I’d like to continue to hone my craft as a designer and product-thinker. I’m always up for challenging myself in driving the definition and execution of product design processes.
